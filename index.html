  		A new field lay beneath my window
  		</h1>
      <p>It was green and wide, and dotted with tiny white flowers. The sky was mostly clear, though I could see clouds in the distance.</p>
      <p>On this excruciatingly hot humid weather, laying down looking straight up from the soft field, a sudden shower of cold, soothing droplets rained 
      down on my face.  Closing my eyes, thinking how wonderful it is for it to be raining, i emerge rememberin that there were no clouds in sight.  I open hom
      my eyes to a large flock of birds flying overhead.  How I wish I was home.</p
